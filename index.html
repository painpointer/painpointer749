<h1 style="text-align:center;">Are popups will hurt our SEO performance </h1>
<p>To answer this we need to understand the types of popups <br>

<br>First, what is a popup?<br>
<br>The popup is a window or a page that suddenly appears while interacting with the webpage. </p>

<img style="width:50%" src="image01.jpg">
<p>There are two types of popups<br> 
<br>1. Own website popups <br>
<br>2. Third party websites popups <br><br><br>
</p>
<p>1. Own website popups<br><br> 
 
<br>Using code we can derive our wish popup.<br> 

<br>Generally, popups are used to display product discounts, offers, email subscriptions, etc.<br> <br>


<br>Things to remember while arranging popups for our website <br>

<br>* Popups should be easy to close<br> 
<br>* Avoid popups on the first load, especially on mobile devices<br> 
<br>* Don't use " INTRUSIVE " popups<br> 
 
<br>Intrusive popups cover the entire page's content. <br>
